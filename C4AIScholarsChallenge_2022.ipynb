    "Welcome to the C4AI Scholars Program Take-Home Challenge! This exercise is designed to allow you to showcase your engineering and problem solving skills. The Challenge consists of three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Part One of the challenge requires identifying bugs, and getting the code working. This is designed to test your ability to grapple with real world engineering challenges.\n",
    "* Part Two of the challenge tests your ability to generate code for a specified problem.\n",
    "* Part Three of the challenge is an opportunity for you to attempt an optional challenge question that extends the original problem set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These tasks were chosen as a setting to see how you think about problems, even if they are not in your own research field of interest. The tasks and dataset are not meant to be indicative of the research goals of the Scholar Program. We purposefully have selected a simple toy problem so the focus is on how you think, and does not require significant machine learning resources.\n",

    "## Overview of Singular Value Decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "In this takehome, you will be working on a problem involving singular value decomposition. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) exists for every rectangular matrix. The nice thing about SVD is that the original matrix can be expressed as the sum of outer products of left and singular vectors scaled by the corresponding singular values. Formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let 𝛢 be a rectangular matrix of dimensions 𝑚𝘹𝑛, then the SVD of the matrix A is given by $ A = U𝛴V^T$ where $U$ is an orthogonal matrix of shape mxm containing the left singular vectors, $V$ is an orthogonal matrix of shape nxn containing the right singular vectors and $𝛴$ is a diagonal matrix containing the singular values of $A$. This formulation of SVD can be re-expressed as \\begin{align} A = \\sum_{i=1}^{r} s_i. u_i v_i^T \\end{align} where $r = \\text{min}(m,n)$ represents the rank of the matrix, $s_i$ is the $i$th singular value and $u_i v_i^T$ is the outer product of the $i$th left and right singular vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- \\begin{align}\n",
    "A = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\text{min}(m,n)} s_i. u_i v_i^T\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\\begin{align} -->\n",
    "\n",
    "> The singular values $𝛴$ are decreasing in order. So, each outer product is scaled by a smaller value as we compute each term in the sum above. This gives us an opportunity to approximate $A$ using only the sum of the first $k$ outer products where $k < \\text{min}(m,n)$ $-$ this effectively means that we are zero-ing out some of the singular values by assuming that the contribution to the sum is negligible. This is called low-rank approximation.\n",

    "\n",
    "Demerits:\n",
    "*   Approach cannot be used to improve training time, we need a pre-trained over-parameterized model, to begin with\n",
    "*   Only linear Deep Neural Network layers like convolution (tucker and cp decomposition) and fully connected layers benefit, algorithms ignore the nonlinearity that comes after them\n",
    "*   SVD decomposition works layer by layer ignoring interactions between layers. In that sense, they are greedy and maybe sub-optimal\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing SVD with Pruning and efficient architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Efficient architectures are the go-to technique when we need to train a model from scratch. Unlike, SVD and Pruning we don't require a pre-trained model\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pruning typically requires multiple forward and backward passes on the model using the data to effectively perform model compression\n",
    "\n",
    "* Low-rank approximations seem like the fastest way to achieve a compressed model, we just need to redefine the model arch in a specific way and compute the decompositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pruning and efficient architecture for a problem achieve model compression by learning from the data in a global sense, as opposed to SVD which greedily picks up a layer and does the decomposition\n",
    "\n",
    "* Most Pruning algorithms need specialized support to improve inference time, currently libraries' support for sparse tensor operations seems limited. Libraries like PyTorch use masking at runtime to implement pruning but this will not help the runtime performance of the model\n",

    "### Q5: Does replacing the weight matrix with the low factor matrix result in latency speed ups?\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot the relationship of time (y-axis) vs rank percentage (x-axis). To do so add code to compute the ranks_and_times list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: No, Latency is similar to latency on the full matrix, this is because the number of multiplications required to do inference remains the same in this implementation. The latency at rank fraction 1 is marginally higher becuase of jit comilation, which happens when the first inference is done."
